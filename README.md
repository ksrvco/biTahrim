# biTahrim

# About :
Due to the fact that some usable and effective sites in the world are restricted for Iranian users and this restriction has been imposed by those websites and under their own laws, so Iranian users can not access those websites with their location in iran. This issue can create an important limitation for Iranian users such as computer programmers, experts in various fields, etc. A long time ago, an Iranian company named "Bonyan" launched a project called Shecan that could bypass these restrictions and allow Iranian users to access the banned websites. But there are concerns about whether the shecan service will stores and also monitoring users informations? Because no article or document has been technically shared. In this biTahrim project, I implemented exactly the same function and I publish it open source. Different Iranian businesses and users can easily launch this project on their Linux servers and easily access the websites that have banned Iranian users.
